Yo hackers! It’s 0xStrawHat again 🏴‍☠️

An enthusiastic pwner and web hacker with a love for breaking anything that can be hacked.

I have a deep passion for the thrill of the hunt, constantly sharpening my skills in the art of exploitation.

Playing CTFs is not just a hobby, it's a lifestyle where I push my limits and learn something new every day.

I am proud to be a **pwner @0xL4ugh team**, collaborating with brilliant minds to solve complex challenges.

Whether it's binary exploitation or web vulnerabilities, I'm always ready to dive into the code.

Welcome to my world of security research, where every crash is an opportunity and every shell is a victory.
